Over the past few weeks, I have been working on completing my project for Module 1. The purpose of this project was to clean, organize, and analyze sets of data about movies in order to give recommendations to Microsoft to create original content for their new streaming platform. In performing this analysis, I was looking to answer three key questions:
1. Which movie studios made the most money?
2. What are the highest rated movie genres?
3. How does production budget effect a movie's earnings?

It was determined that the movie studios that made the most money were Buena Vista, Fox, Sony, Universal, and Warner Brothers; the highest rated movie genres were mixed genres that included Action, Comedy, Documentary, Family, and Musical; and movies with a budget of $250 million or more gross the most in theatres. Future iterations of this analysis should look more in depth at these findings. Beyond which studios made the most money, I think it would be important to look at the genres of movies each studio makes. Some questions that could be answered include: What genre grosses the most per studio? Do studios stick to a specific genre or is there variability? Deeper analysis could also include looking at what the average production budget looks like for each genre, as well as which genres do better in foreign or domestic markets.

While recommendations were made to assist Microsoft with their new content, more can be done to help them better understand the new industry they are breaking into. It is my hope that were more analysis needed, Microsoft would be able to go further using the extra questions I outlined above.
